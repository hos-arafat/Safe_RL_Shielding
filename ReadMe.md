# Pacman Environment Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements

- Install [Python 2.7](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMPHH_10.5.0/com.ibm.guardium.doc.admin/ecosystem/installing_python_2.7.9_OSX.html) (*we recommend using [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/) or [Anaconda](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-mac-os-x)*).
- Make sure [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook) is installed.

## Usage Instructions

- Navigate to the folder containing the **Pacman_Notebook_Submission.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook
- [Launch the Jupyter Notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook##UseJupyter)
- Once the Jupyter Notebook is launched, press "Cell" > "Run All". This will start several Pacman games with a different "maze" / layout. For each layout, Pacman will first play 2 episodes **without** the shield followed by 2 episodes *with* the shield, in order to showcase the difference and the advantages of the shield.
